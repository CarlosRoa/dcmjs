        <h1>dcmjs Examples</h1>
        <p>
            These examples are meant to demonstrate various aspects of the dcmjs library in an interactive way.
            They are written such that they can be opened directly in your web browser from github or your local
            repository. Use the "view source" capabilities built into your browser to see how each example works.
